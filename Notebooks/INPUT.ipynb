    "Real time information for Tropical cyclones are available from various sources. These depend on the corresponding basin since there are different designated service providers for each basin according to the World Meteological Organization (WMO). These are called 'Regional Specialized Meteorological Centres' (RSMC). In addition to those, there are Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers (TCWCs) that also provide information sometimes different from the RSMC's but generally cover a broader region. Naturally there are also the national services called 'National Meteorological and Hydrological Services' (NMHSs) which might be limited in scope. \n",

The atmosphere-ocean coupled HWRF system consists of multiple movable two-way interactive nested grids that follow the projected path of the storm. Atmospheric component of the HWRF model was coupled to the Princeton Ocean Model (POM) developed by GFDL/URI using a sophisticated coupler developed at NCEP for providing accurate representation of air-sea interactions. An advanced vortex initialization scheme and NCEP GSI based HWRF Data Assimilation System (HDAS) provide means to represent the initial location, intensity, size and structure of the inner core of a hurricane and it’s large-scale environment. The NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS) analysis and forecasts provide initial and boundary conditions for the HWRF model.

Over the ocean an adjustment factor is applied, which is a function of radius from the center ranging from 0.9 to 0.7, and the winds are turned 20 degrees toward low pressure. Over land, the oceanic winds are reduced by an additional 20% and turned an additional 20 degrees toward low pressure.\n",

It also can be applied to all phases of the TC lifecycle; something that previous objective schemes could not do. Finally, the ADT makes use of statistical analysis results obtained from a 10+ year sample of North Atlantic storms, along with a significant sample of West and East Pacific storms, covering the entire spectrum of TC intensities to derive a regression-based intensity value estimate for various phases of the TC lifecycle.\"\n",
