    "Introduction: The intent of the IBTrACS project is to overcome data availability issues, and to freely disseminate this new global dataset. This was achieved by working directly with all the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers and other international centers and individuals to create a global best track dataset, merging storm information from multiple centers into one product and archiving the data for public use. One of the goals of the project is for the data processing methods to remain open, such that desired user feedback on data quality is more easily collected. Also, data provenance is completely recorded so all observations and corrections, either through rigorous quality control or user feedback, may be tracked. Data are then provided in various formats given the diversity of the tropical cyclone (TC) data user community (see http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/ )\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: in IBTrACS database vmax is 10-min wind and not 1-min!!! all winds are reported as 10-minute winds. Data from NOAA (HURDAT, CPHC), JTWC and the RSMC New Delhi (IMD) all provide data as 1-minute. Winds were converted to 10-min using: V10 = 0.88 * V1\n"
